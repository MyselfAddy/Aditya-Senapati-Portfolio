# Aditya-Senapati-Portfolio

This is a single-page static portfolio for Aditya Senapati.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `aditya-portfolio` (or any name).
2. Add `index.html` and `styles.css` to the repo root and commit.
3. On GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source → Choose `main` branch / root → Save.
4. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (or at `https://<your-username>.github.io/` if repo named `<your-username>.github.io`).

## Customize
- Update contact links (LinkedIn/GitHub) in `index.html` (search for `your-linkedin` and `your-github`).
- Replace project descriptions with links to your GitHub repos.
- To use your own domain, add `CNAME` file with domain name and configure DNS as required.

## Tips
- Add project READMEs and Live Demo links (Colab / Streamlit) to each project section.
- Convert this into a multi-page site later (Resume / Projects / Blog).
